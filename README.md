## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- DOM

### What I learned

I was able to practice using the DOM for this exercise. 

### Continued development

I want to refactor the code a bit and use more of the DOM to style the project. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) - This helped me when using the Document Object Model to create this project. 
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) - This Udemy course has helped to learn how to use the DOM. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
